# Introduction

`RabBit` is a easy to use, multiplatform engine for game develop written in **C++17**.

## Goals

- Provide platform implementations as many as possible.
- Producing high-quality modern code.
- Making a game engine as simple as possible.

## Requirements

To be able to use `RabBit`, users must provide a full-featured compiler that supports at least `C++17` and `CMake` version **3.16** or later.

# Architecture

## Overview

RabBit's architecture is very modular and does not require the use of all modules *(more like a framework)*. It's up to you which features of the engine you want to use depending on your needs.

RabBit is divided into specific services (`renderer`, `physics`), and communication with them is done using `handle`s. Objects such as `texture` or `body` are simple wrappers for `handle`s generated by services.

An example of creating a physical body directly using `handle`s (without wrappers):

```cpp
physics physics;
handle shape = physics.create_circle_shape(2.0f);
handle body = physics.create_body(body_type::type_static);
physics.set_body_shape(shape);
physics.destroy_body(body);
physics.destroy_shape(shape);
```

Note the need to manually delete objects. Wrappers can help us a lot with this.

Example of using wrappers:

```cpp
physics physics;
body body(physics, body_type::type_static);
body.set_shape(circle_shape(physics, 2.0f));
```

Wrappers are also reference counted. If we want to use them in many places in the code, we must use the `ref` class.

```cpp
physics physics;
ref<body> body = body(physics, body_type::type_static);
body->set_shape(circle_shape(physics, 2.0f));
```

## Feel free

RabBit comes with ECS (thanks to [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt)), but it's up to you if you want to use it.
No service uses ECS directly, so you can build your own abstraction.

You can use any other physics or rendering engine in the same way.

## Under the hood

- Rendering: Vulkan 1.3
- Physics: [Box2D](https://box2d.org)
- Networking: [ENet](http://enet.bespin.org)
- ECS: [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt)

# Code Examples

## Hello World

```cpp
#include <rabbit/rabbit.hpp>

using namespace rb;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    window window("Hello World", { 1280, 720 }, false);

    window.on<close_event>().connect<&window::close>(window);

    while (window.is_open()) {
        window.dispatch();
    }
}
```

## Setup renderer

```cpp
#include <rabbit/rabbit.hpp>

using namespace rb;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    window window("Hello World", { 1280, 720 }, false);
    renderer renderer(window);

    window.on<close_event>().connect<&window::close>(window);

    while (window.is_open()) {
        window.dispatch();

        renderer.display(color::cornflower_blue());
    }
}
```

## Draw texture

```cpp
#include <rabbit/rabbit.hpp>

using namespace rb;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    window window("Hello World", { 1280, 720 }, false);
    renderer renderer(window);
    painter painter(renderer, { 320, 180 });

    texture texture = texture_loader(renderer)("buddy.png");

    window.on<close_event>().connect<&window::close>(window);

    while (window.is_open()) {
        window.dispatch();

        painter.draw(texture, { 0.0f, 0.0f }, color::white());

        renderer.display(color::cornflower_blue());
    }
}
```
